<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![overview]()

You can find the demo [here](). This project is made with the purpose to practice and consolidate my knowledge about Javascript bases. You will be able to find a Web Catalog with objective of display the La Lana Land's products generating an easy way to share their products.

### Built With

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a solution to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/hH6PbOHBdPm6otzw2De5) was to build an application to complete the following user stories (I add and modify some of the user stories).

**User stories**
- I can see a list of products with its name, price and image
- I can sort the products for price, name
- I can organize the number of columns I want to see
- I can see the list of products by category
- I can see the info of products in a modal
